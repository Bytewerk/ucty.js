# µcty
browser-compatible minimum space geographical maps proof of concept

## features
* convert [`OSM`](http://openstreetmap.org) files into minimal a minimal, `LZMA` compressed lossy format
* view the whole map in your browser with a tiny `HTML5` canvas based client
* server: any `HTTPD` will do, that can server two files statically ;)

## status
* this is the work of three days or so, don't expect all the features that you know from the normal open street map or google maps pages!
* map size is limited by what the openstreetmap page can export right now
* streets aren't displayed at all

## minimal?
|OSM Size|µcty map, including the HTML5 client|
