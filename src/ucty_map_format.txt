this is the minimal JSON format, that will get compressed. Don't confuse this with the enhanched map format after the client-side init.



var map = [
	ucty_entry_1,
	ucty_entry_2,
	...
];



var ucty_entry =
[
	ucty_type,
	ucty_caption,
	ucty_coords
	[width - only for linestrings!]
];

Linestrings and Polygons differ in the coords array.

Linestring coords:
[x,y], [x,y], [x,y], ...

Polygon coords are grouped:
[[x,y], ...], [[x,y], ...], ...
